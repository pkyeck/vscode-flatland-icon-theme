# vscode-flatland-icon-theme-custom
A simple and clear structure of the directory icon theme

Original version: https://github.com/gebilaoxiong/vscode-flatland-icon-theme

I customised a couple of things: 

- no arrows in front of folders
- no spacing in front of files
- different colors for root/normal folders
